# AU-Registration-Bot
A Discord bot written in python to help with registering players for Alternate Universe's Remote Duel YCS, an online yugioh tournament played over webcam, for Konami. This was written specifically for this tournament and as is only functions on the discord server it was written for. 

This bot DMs users a link to sign up and pay for the tournament they want to play in and once enough players are signed up it alerts the scorekeeper for the event that it can start, creates a channel, and a role for the event as well.

This can be bipassed as well in case the user wants to start an event with less than 8 players.

One of the events, Attack of the Giant Card, starts at a specific time. I have included commands for the scorekeeper to open and close registration so that it can start with any number of entrants.

MY BOT HAS COME A LONG WAY

I have included the original file as OLDAUregistrationbot to show how much I have learned while creating this.
